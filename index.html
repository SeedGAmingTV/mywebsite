		<p>I'm SeedGamingTV or Evan and here is my own scuffed website. Here I will be posting updates and videos that are uploaded to my YouTube as well as weekly fan comments.</p>

	<h1>A little bit about me:</h1>
			<p>I am 15 almost 16 years old and I live in the United States. My coding abilities are limited but I built this website by myself. I do GTA V videos and Minecraft videos but I don't have a video editor yet. 
			<br>I know my profile picture is pretty freaky, I made it that way. Microsoft Paint is a wonderful thing to make freaky stuff.</br>
			I also know this website is pretty bland but I intend to keep it updated.
